# Quick Fix for AvoRinks Deployment

## The Issue
Render can't find your website files because the `public` folder wasn't uploaded to GitHub.

## Fast Solution: Use Replit's Download Feature

**Step 1: Download Your Files**
1. In Replit, click the three dots menu (⋮) next to any file
2. Select "Download as zip" 
3. Extract the zip file on your computer

**Step 2: Upload to GitHub**
1. Go to: https://github.com/HelloYellowWord/avorinks-chatroom
2. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
3. Drag these files from your extracted folder:
   - The entire `public` folder (contains index.html, script.js, style.css)
   - `server.js` (if you need to update it with the port fix)
4. Add commit message: "Add missing public folder"
5. Click "Commit changes"

**Step 3: Render Will Auto-Deploy**
- Render detects the GitHub changes and redeploys automatically
- Wait 2-3 minutes for the build to complete
- Your AvoRinks will be live

## Alternative: Manual File Creation
If download doesn't work, create these files manually on GitHub:

1. `public/index.html` - Your main webpage
2. `public/script.js` - Chat functionality 
3. `public/style.css` - Visual styling

Copy the content from your Replit files into GitHub.
