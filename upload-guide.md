# Fix for AvoRinks Deployment - Missing Public Folder

## The Problem
Render shows: `Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat '/opt/render/project/src/public/index.html'`

This means the `public` folder (containing your website files) wasn't uploaded to GitHub.

## Solution: Upload Missing Files

Go to your GitHub repository and upload these files:

### Required Files to Upload:

1. **public/index.html** - Your main webpage
2. **public/script.js** - JavaScript chat functionality  
3. **public/style.css** - Website styling

### How to Upload:

1. Go to: https://github.com/HelloYellowWord/avorinks-chatroom
2. Click "Add file" â†’ "Upload files"
3. Upload each file individually OR create the folder structure:
   - Click "Create new file"
   - Type: `public/index.html`
   - Paste the content from your local files
   - Repeat for script.js and style.css

### File Contents (if needed):

The files are in your Replit project. You can copy-paste their contents when creating the files on GitHub.

After uploading, Render will automatically redeploy and your chatroom will work.
